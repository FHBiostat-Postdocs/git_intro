Hi,

The file you're looking at is a markdown (.md file). Here's a [link](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to learn some markdown syntax. Github is a website built on a program called git, which does version control.

# Start with Github

1. Make an account on [Github](https://github.com).
2. Download/Install git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3. You're ready to begin.

# Repositories

1. Make a repo under our [organization](https://github.com/FHBiostat-Postdocs)
2. Click on the green "New" button and name your repo.
3. Once created on Github, on your local machine/computer, clone the repo from Github. 

  For Windows users, open the Git Bash program, navigate to the folder you want to save the repo. On Github on your repo's page, click on the green "Code" button, copy the https link. In the Git Bash program, type `git clone <copied_https_link>`.
